# QuickUp上架微软应用商店
QuickUp-3.13版本正式上架微软应用商店，供用户免费下载使用。

从此版本开始，QuickUp的任务文件将移动到`%appdata%/QuickUp/tasks`下，无论是通过商店msix安装还是通过发行版exe安装的QuickUp都如此。如果是首次使用QuickUp，建议从微软应用商店安装。如果已经在使用QuickUp，请**手动**备份或转义任务文件。

另外，从此版本开始，QuickUp将不再提供自动更新功能，因为QuickUp已无功能更新。3.13版本的唯一改进就是修复创建任务后立刻删除能够成功，但是UI界面未删除指定任务栏目的问题，绝大部分情况下不影响使用，可继续使用3.12版本。

# QuickUp is now available on the Microsoft Store

QuickUp-3.13 has been officially launched on the Microsoft Store for free download and use by users.

Starting from this version, QuickUp's task files will be moved to `%appdata%/QuickUp/tasks`, whether QuickUp is installed through the store msix or through the distribution exe. If it's your first time using QuickUp, it is recommended to install it from the Microsoft Store. If you are already using QuickUp, please manually back up or escape the task file.

In addition, starting from this version, QuickUp will no longer provide an automatic update function because QuickUp no longer has the ability to update. The only improvement in version 3.13 is to fix the issue where the creation of a task could be immediately deleted successfully, but the specified task column was not deleted in the UI interface. In most cases, this does not affect usage and version 3.12 can still be used.
