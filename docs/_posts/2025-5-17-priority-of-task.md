# About the Priority of Task

Each workspace under QuickUp `tasks` folder may have a `priority.txt` file. If there is no such a file, then the first click to the *star-button* of a task in this workspace will create this file.

The tasks in each line in this file will be placed at the top of the task-view in this workspace. The order of the top-pinned tasks is the order in this file.
