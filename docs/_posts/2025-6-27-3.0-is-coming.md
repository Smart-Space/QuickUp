# QuickUp 3.0 发布

2025年6月27日，QuickUp 3.0发布。

本次更新主要添加了备注模块（包括并行/单线模式，是否显示与置顶），并为单命令模块重新设计了编辑界面。到此，QuickUp已经基本实现了我希望其拥有的所有功能。

另外，模糊搜索也改为了自行编写的模块（具体见源码中`quickfuzz.h`），大幅减小了发行版QuickUp的体积。

最重要的一点是，从QuickUp 3.0版本开始，将在GPLv3开源协议和LGPLv3附加条款下开放其源代码。

# QuickUp 3.0 Released

On June 27, 2025, QuickUp 3.0 was released.

This update mainly adds a tips (remarks) module (including threading mode, whether to display and top), and redesigns the editing interface for the single command module. By now, QuickUp has basically achieved all the functions I hoped it would have.

In addition, fuzzy search has also been changed to a self-written module (for details, see `quickfuzz.h` in the source code), significantly reducing the size of the distribution QuickUp.

The most important point is that starting from version 3.0 of QuickUp, its source code will be made available under the GPLv3 open source license and the additional terms of LGPLv3.
