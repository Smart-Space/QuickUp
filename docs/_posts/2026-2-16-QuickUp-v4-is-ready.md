# QuickUp v4 准备就绪

截止本文完稿，QuickUp-4.0尚未正式发布，但已经基本完成。

什么？QuickUp在2025年年中就进入稳定版了？我不知道，那是QuickUp-3.0进入稳定版本了，但你看看标题呢？**QuickUp-4.0**带来了主要功能更新：

- 可尝试调整任务应用窗口的位置与尺寸。

  也就是说，现在的QuickUp不仅可以帮你唤起应用组，而且还可以一定程度上帮你对应用窗口进行排布。

  为什么是**尝试**呢？请看[QuickUp Zone](https://quickup.smart-space.com.cn/QuickUp-zone/)。
  
- 任务进展的UI提示。

- 正式对启用隐藏任务的支持。

如果v4进入稳定版了会如何？发布号将会延续3.0时代稳定版的编号。

# QuickUp v4 is ready

As of the completion of this article, QuickUp-4.0 has not yet been officially released, but it has been basically completed.

What? QuickUp has entered a stable version in mid-2025? I don't know, that's when QuickUp-3.0 has entered a stable version, but look at the title? **QuickUp-4.0** brings major feature updates:

- Try adjusting the position and size of the task application window.

  In other words, current QuickUp can not only help you evoke application groups, but also help you arrange application windows to a certain extent.

  Why I said **try**? Please see [QuickUp Zone](https://quickup.smart-space.com.cn/QuickUp-zone/).

- UI information for task progress.

- Official support for hidden tasks.

What happens if v4 enters a stable version? The release number will continue the number of the stable version in the 3.0 era.
